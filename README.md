This is a sample web project created using the directions on the Gradle Web
Application Quickstart at
<https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/web_project_tutorial.html>.

The Gretty server in the example has been substituted with the Tomcat plugin at
<https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-tomcat-plugin>

The project also includes a basic deployment descriptor (`web.xml`).
